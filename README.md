# Lean-six-sigma-Case-study---Gentech

## Introduction
Gentech, a multinational company with a $60 billion annual revenue, faced an 18% reduction in the last two years. Tasked by CEO Elliot Smith, the VP of supply chain operations, Grace Monroe, initiated a Lean Six Sigma project led by Jeff Hugh to streamline the proposal creation process, aiming to reduce the cycle time by 15%. This case study presents the journey from problem identification to solutions implementation.

## Objective
The project aimed to apply the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC framework to identify and eliminate inefficiencies in Gentechâ€™s proposal creation process. Key goals included reducing cycle time, minimizing non-value-added activities, standardizing workflows across geographies, and enabling faster, more effective proposal delivery to clients.

## Dataset
The project utilized a comprehensive dataset encompassing multiple dimensions such as year, geography, seller, brand, month, and various timestamps representing different stages of the proposal creation process. Additional feedback columns captured seller and BSS sentiments, bid size, and specific issues encountered during the process.

## Conclusion
The Lean Six Sigma intervention revealed major delays due to inconsistent approvals, data quality issues, and unnecessary process loops. By addressing these bottlenecks and leveraging data-driven insights, the team proposed a redesigned, streamlined workflow. These changes are projected to reduce proposal cycle times by 15% and improve overall operational efficiency and customer responsiveness.
